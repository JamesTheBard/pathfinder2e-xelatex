# Quick and Dirty

I use `xelatex` to build everything, so if you're on Windows I recommend grabbing MikTeX, and if you're on Linux I recommend TeXLive.

# Things you'll need

Actions are rendered from a font called `Pathfinder2eActions.ttf`.  This needs to be installed on your system otherwise XeLaTeX is going to be very, very angry.  Also, I use `Adobe Garamond Pro` for my documents.  It's a great font, but I'm 103% sure Adobe isn't going to let me distribute that font in any shape, way, form, or fashion.  Just make sure you change the font via the `\setmainfont` command in the `.tex` file.
